The expression "readme file" is also sometimes used generically, for files with a similar purpose.[citation needed] For example, the source code distributions of many free software packages, especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools, include a standard set of readme files:

README	General information
AUTHORS	Credits
THANKS	Acknowledgments
CHANGELOG	A detailed changelog, intended for programmers
NEWS	A basic changelog, intended for users
INSTALL	Installation instructions
COPYING / LICENSE	Copyright and licensing information
BUGS	Known bugs and instructions on reporting new ones
CONTRIBUTING / HACKING	Guide for prospective contributors to the project
